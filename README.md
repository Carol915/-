# 60 Days of LeetCode / 代码随想录算法训练营 学习笔记 

## Introduction

Welcome to my journey through a 60-day LeetCode challenge! My aim is to enhance my problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency by engaging with a diverse range of algorithmic challenges on LeetCode daily. The structure of this endeavor is inspired by Carl's "Programming Thoughts 代码随想录" (found at programmercarl.com), which thoughtfully compiles and categorizes 150 classic LeetCode questions, offering a more systematic approach to learning.

### What is LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for improving coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a vast collection of programming problems across various domains, from data structures and algorithms to databases and shell scripting.

### Challenge Goal

My goal is to solve one or more LeetCode problems every day for 60 days, and achieve in total **150 Leetcode problems** by the end of the challenge. For each problem, I intend to explore it in-depth, **employing various methods** and **documenting my learning process through comprehensive study notes** (this is the essence of my solutions). This challenge is not just about solving problems but also about understanding and learning different algorithms and data structures.

> **Note**: The list will be updated daily with links to the problems and my solutions.

## Reflections

After each week, I will share my reflections on the problems solved, challenges faced, and the learnings acquired.

- [Week 1 Reflection](link-to-reflection)
- [Week 2 Reflection](link-to-reflection)

## How to Navigate

- The `solutions` directory contains all my solutions, categorized by the problem number.
- The `reflections` directory hosts my weekly reflections and learnings.
