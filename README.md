# Caroline's LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I tackle a diverse array of algorithmic challenges, with each problem aimed at enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of key algorithms and data structures. Inspired by Carl's "Programming Thoughts 代码随想录" (found at programmercarl.com), this repository organizes LeetCode problems into **chapters**, each corresponding to a different algorithm or data structure. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive learning experience, rather than randomly selecting problems.

### What is LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for improving coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a vast collection of programming problems across various domains, including data structures, algorithms, databases, and shell scripting.

### Purpose

For each LeetCode problem I work on, I explore multiple solution methods and document my approach through comprehensive study notes. My focus is on building a solid understanding of problem-solving strategies rather than just obtaining a solution. Problems are grouped by topic (chapter) to allow for focused practice and mastery of specific algorithms.

## Chapters

Each chapter corresponds to a specific algorithm or data structure, with problems organized in increasing complexity within each chapter.

- **Chapter 1: Arrays**
  
- **Chapter 2: Linked Lists**
 
- **Chapter 3: Hash Tables**
 
> **Note**: This list will be updated continuously with links to new problems and solutions.


## Contributing

While this is a personal repository, I'm open to discussions and suggestions! Feel free to open an issue for any questions or suggestions on alternative solutions.
