# 60 Days of LeetCode 

## About

Welcome to my 60-day challenge of solving LeetCode algorithm problems! This project is aimed at enhancing my problem-solving and coding skills by tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges from LeetCode every day. 

### What is LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for improving coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a vast collection of programming problems across various domains, from data structures and algorithms to databases and shell scripting.

### Challenge Goal

My goal is to solve one or more LeetCode problems every day for 60 days. This challenge is not just about solving problems but also about understanding and learning different algorithms and data structures.

## Progress

- **Day 1**: [Array Part01](link-to-problem) - [Solution](link-to-your-solution)
- **Day 2**: [Problem Name](link-to-problem) - [Solution](link-to-your-solution)
- ...

> **Note**: The list will be updated daily with links to the problems and my solutions.

## Reflections

After each week, I will share my reflections on the problems solved, challenges faced, and the learnings acquired.

- [Week 1 Reflection](link-to-reflection)
- [Week 2 Reflection](link-to-reflection)
- ...

## How to Navigate

- The `solutions` directory contains all my solutions, categorized by the problem number.
- The `reflections` directory hosts my weekly reflections and learnings.

## Contributing

While this is a personal challenge, I'm open to discussions and suggestions! Feel free to open an issue for any questions or suggestions on alternative solutions.
